    %h2 Why?
    %p Great data inform great decision-making. By using the same measures we can share lessons learned and increase our impact.

    %h2 Why These Measures?
    %p A team from Oregon State University Cascades in Bend, Oregon scanned the literature for measures that explored resilience beyond the individual perspective to include relational, community, and cultural factors. They also looked for something free, short, trustworthy, strengths-based, culturally responsive, and available in multiple languages.

  %h2 About These Resilience Measures
  %p This collaborative measurement-focused project between <a href="http://tracesco.org">TRACEs</a> (<u>T</u>rauma, <u>R</u>esiliency, and <u>A</u>dverse <u>C</u>hildhood <u>E</u>xperience<u>s</u>) Central Oregon and <a href="https://osucascades.edu">Oregon State University Cascades</a> was an effort to collect and organize easy-to-use measures that have been developed to assess resilience-promoting factors (aka protective factors). <a href="https://osucascades.edu">OSU-Cascades</a> researchers collaborated with leaders from the <a href="http://tracesco.org">TRACEs</a> initiative to develop a collection of resilience-promoting measures that may be useful here in Central Oregon (Deschutes, Crook, and Jefferson Counties) in an effort to better understand and measure resilience. <a href="https://osucascades.edu">OSU-Cascades</a> faculty and students collated and organized existing, validated and easy-to-use measures. Then they developed and provided details about this collection in this password-protected online platform so that <a href="http://tracesco.org">TRACEs</a> community partners across service sectors could consider using strength-based measures.
  %p In addition, researchers identified a select core set of resilience-promoting measures (see <a href="/measures/tag?tag=shared">Shared Measures</a> for more details) that could be used in Central Oregon across ages, counties and sectors. The goal being that if we can measure these protective factors, then we can also work together to nurture those protective factors.
  %p Protective factors are typically organized into three categories: <a href="/measures/category?category=individual">Individual-level</a>, <a href="/measures/category?category=relational">Family/Relational-level</a> and <a href="/measures/category?category=community">Community-level</a> protective factors. This collection of measures also includes a fourth category, <a href="/measures/category?category=general">General resilience measures</a>. These <a href="/measures/category?category=general">general measures</a> were designed to assess more than one protective factor or to assess general resilience-promoting factors.
  %p Thank you for being here and exploring the resilience measures website. While the site does have all the measures uploaded and available for you to explore, we recognize that there are some design and functionality edits that still need to be made. Our team is diligently working on these to improve the look and feel of the website over time. If you have any feedback on the site, the measures, or general questions please don't hesitate to reach out to us at <a href="mailto:tracesmeasures@gmail.com">tracesmeasures@gmail.com</a>. Thank you for your patience and we look forward to hearing from you.
